# MIPs
MIP stands for MinexCoin Improvement Proposal. An MIP is a design document providing information to the MinexCoin community, or describing a new feature for MinexCoin or its processes or environment. The MIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The MIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

# Contributing
